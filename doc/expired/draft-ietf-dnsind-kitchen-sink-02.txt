Abstract

   Periodically people desire to put proprietary, complex, and/or
   obscure data into the Domain Name System (DNS).  This draft defines a
   kitchen sink Resource Record that will satisfy this desire for the
   storage of miscellaneous structured information.

INTERNET-DRAFT                          The Kitchen Sink Resource Record


1. Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a replicated distributed secure
   hierarchical database which stores "resource records" (RRs) under
   hierarchical domain names.  This data is structured into zones which
   are independently maintained.  [RFC 1034, 1035, 2535]

   Numerous types of RRs have been defined.  These support such critical
   functions as host name to address translation (A, AAAA, etc.  RRs),
   automatic mail routing (MX etc. RRs), and other functions. In
   addition, there are RRs defined related to the zone structure and
   administration of the DNS (SOA, NS, and RP RRs), security (SIG, KEY,
   and NXT RRs), etc.  There is a TXT RR for the inclusion of general
   human readable text.

   New RRs that are reasonably simple and designed via the open IETF
   standards process are periodically added as new needs become
   apparent.  But there are people who want to put some proprietary,
   complex and/or non-standard structured data in the DNS.  In the past
   they have frequently come up with some way of reinterpreting the TXT
   RR, since that is one of the least constrained RRs.  This is likely a
   bad idea since all previous ways to reinterpreting the TXT RR have
   sunk without a trace.  (Well, if they actually got an RFC out, it's
   still there, but, practically speaking, almost nobody actually uses
   it.)

   If a new type of data is needed for a global interoperable use in the
   DNS, the best course is to design a new RR that meets the need
   through the IETF standards process.  This draft defines an extremely
   general and flexible RR which can be used for other data, such as
   proprietary data, where global interoperability is not a
   consideration.  It includes representations of OSI ASN.1, MIME, XML,
   and, recursively, DNS RRs.



2. Kitchen Sink Resource Record

   The symbol for the kitchen sink resource record is SINK.  Its type
   number is 40.  This type is defined across all DNS classes.

   The RDATA portion of the SINK RR is structured as follows:

          +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The "meaning", "coding", and "subcoding" octets are always present.
   The "data" portion is variable length and could be null in some
   cases.  The size of the "data" portion can always be determined by
   subtracting 3 from the SINK resource record RDLENGTH.  The coding
   octet gives the general structure of the data.  The subcoding octet
   provides additional information depending on the value of the coding
   nibble.

   All references to "domain name" in this document mean a domain name
   in the DNS CLASS of the SINK RR.



2.1 The Meaning Octet

   The meaning octet indicates whether any semantic tagging appears at
   the beginning of the data field and the format of such semantic
   tagging.  This contrasts with the coding and subcoding octets which
   merely indicate format.  The inclusion of such semantic tagging is
   encouraged and it is expected to be the primary means by which
   applications determine if a SINK RR is of the variety in which they
   have interest.

   It is noted that multiple popular uses of SINK could develop that are
   not distinguished by using different parts of the DNS name space or
   different DNS classes.  If this occurs, retrievals may fetch large
   sets of SINK RR to be sorted through at the application level.
   Should this occur, such popular uses of SINK should obtain and
   migrate to their own RR number using normal RR number allocation
   procedures.  In addition, it would be possible to define an extended
   query operation that selects from among SINK RRs based on the
   semantic tag.

   The types of tags available are chosen to be globally unique and
   under the control of some "owner".  The owner designates the meaning
   associated with the tags they control.  Where the tag is a URI, it is
   recommended that a retrieval from the URI fetch material that would
   be helpful in determining this meaning.  No a priori method is
   defined for determining the meaning of other tags beside an out of

INTERNET-DRAFT                          The Kitchen Sink Resource Record


   band question to the owner.

        INITIAL ASSIGNED MEANING VALUES

     0 - reserved.

     1 - none.
     2 - OID.
     3 - domain name.
     4 - URI.

     5-254 - available for assignment, see section 6.

     255 - reserved.

   A meaning octet value of 1 indicates that there is no semantic
   tagging at the beginning of the data area.  The information, whatever
   it is, starts at the beginning of the data field and is coded
   according to the coding and subcoding octets.

   Meaning octet values of 2, 3, or 4, indicate, on the other hand, that
   a semantic tag is present.  A value of two indicates that a BER
   [X.690] encoded OID appears prefixed by a single unsigned octet of
   OID length count.  A value of three indicates that a DNS domain name
   appears in wire format with name compression prohibited.  And a value
   of four indicates that a null (zero) octet terminated URI appears.



2.2 The Coding and Subcoding Octets

   The coding octet gives the major method by which the data in the data
   field is encoded.  It should always have a meaningful value.  The
   subcoding octet is intended to give additional coding details.
   Although the subcoding octet is always present, it must be
   interpreted in the context of the coding octet.  For any coding octet
   value which does not specify subcoding octet value meanings, the
   subcoding octet MUST be ignored and SHOULD be zero.

   While not explicitly mentioned below, the data field will actually
   start with a semantic tag if indicated by the meaning octet.  If such
   a semantic tag is present, any data prefix required by the coding or
   subcoding octet is placed after the semantic tag and before the data.

   CODING OCTET VALUES

        0 - reserved.

        1 - DNS RRs. The data portion consists of DNS resource records
        as they would be transmitted in a DNS response section.  The


D. Eastlake 3rd                                                 [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT                          The Kitchen Sink Resource Record


        subcoding octet is the number of RRs in the data area as an
        unsigned integer.  Domain names may be compressed via pointers
        as in DNS replies.  The origin for the pointers is the beginning
        of the RDATA section of the SINK RR.  Thus the SINK RR is safe
        to cache since only code that knows how to parse the data
        portion of a SINK RR need know of and can expand these
        compressions.

        2 - MIME structured data [RFC 2045, 2046].  The data portion is
        a MIME structured message.  The "MIME-Version:" header line may
        be omitted unless the version is other than "1.0".  The top
        level Content-Transfer-Encoding may be encoded into the
        subcoding octet (see section 2.2.2).  Note that, to some extent,
        the size limitations of DNS RRs may be overcome in the MIME case
        by using the "Content-Type: message/external-body" mechanism.

        3 - Text tagged data.  The data potion consists of text formated
        as specified in the TXT RR except that the first and every
        subsequent odd numbered text item is considered to be a tag
        labeling the immediately following text item.  If there are an
        odd number of text items overall, then the last is considered to
        label a null text item.  Syntax of the tags is as specified in
        RFC 2396 for the "Authority Component" without the two leading
        slashes ("//") or trailing slash using the DNS for authority.
        Thus any organization with a domain name can assign tags without
        fear of conflict.  The subcodings octet specifies the encoding
        of the labeled text items as specified in section 2.2.3.

        4 - HTML.  The subcoding octet indicates the version of HTML
        with the major version number in the upper nibble and the minor
        version number in the lower nibble.  Thus, for example, HTML 3.2
        would be indicated by a 0x32 octet.

        5 - XML.  The subcoding octet is the version of XML, currently
        1.

        6 - ASN.1 [X.680, etc.].  See section 2.2.1.

        7-251 - Available for assignment, see section 6.

        252 - Private coding format indicated by an OID.  The format of
        the data portion is indicated by an initial BER encoded OID
        which is prefixed by a one octet unsigned length count for the
        OID.  The subcoding octet is available for whatever use the
        private formating wishes to make of it.

        253 - Private coding format indicated by a domain name.  The
        format of the data portion is indicated by an initial wire
        format domain name with compression prohibited.  (Such names are
        self delimiting.) The subcoding octet is available for whatever

INTERNET-DRAFT                          The Kitchen Sink Resource Record


        use the private formating wishes to make of it.

        254 - Private coding format indicated by a URI.  The format of
        the data portion is indicated by an initial URI [RFC 2396] which
        is terminated by a zero (null) valued octet followed by the data
        with that format.  The subcoding octet is available for whatever
        use the private formating wishes to make of it.  The manner in
        which the URI specifies the format is not defined but presumably
        the retriever will recognize the URI by some pattern match.

        255 - reserved.

   NOTE: the existence of a DNS RR coding and the infinite possibilities
   of ASN.1, XML, and MIME permit one to SINK to even greater depths by
   nesting.



2.2.1 ASN.1 Subcodings

   For ASN.1 [X.680, etc.] data, a specific concrete encoding must be
   chosen as indicated by the subcoding octet.

   ASN.* SUBCODINGS

   0 - reserved.
   1 - BER ( Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] ).
   2 - DER ( Distinguished Encoding Rules [X.690] ).
   3 - PER ( Packed Encoding Rules ) Aligned [X.691].
   4 - PER Unaligned [X.691].
   5 - CER ( Canonical Encoding Rules [X.690] ).
   6-253 - available for assignment, see section 6.
   254 - private.  This subcoding will never be assigned to a standard
        set of encoding rules.  An OID preceded by a one octet unsigned
        length of OID appears at the beginning of the data area after
        the ASN coding OID.
   255 - reserved.



2.2.2 MIME Subcodings

   If the coding octet indicates the data is MIME structured, the
   precise encoding is given by the subcoding octets as listed below.

   MIME SUBCODINGS

   0 - reserved, see section 6.
   1 - 7bit.
   2 - 8bit.

INTERNET-DRAFT                          The Kitchen Sink Resource Record


   3 - binary.
   4 - quoted-printable.
   5 - base64.
   6 - 253 - available for assignment, see section 6.
   254 - private.  The data portion must start with an "x-" or "X-"
        token denoting the private content-transfer-encoding immediately
        followed by one null (zero) octet followed by the remainder of
        the MIME object.
   255 - reserved, see section 6.



2.2.3 Text Subcodings

   If the coding octet indicates the data is text, the exact encoding of
   the text items is indicated by the subcoding octet as follows:

   TEXT SUBCODINGS

   0 - reserved, see section 6.
   1 - ASCII.
   2 - UTF-7 [RFC 1642].
   3 - UTF-8 [RFC 2044].
   4 - ASCII with MIME header escapes [RFC 2047].
   5 - 253 - available for assignment, see section 6.
   254 - private.  Each text item must start with a domain name [RFC
        1034] in wire format without compression denoting the private
        text encoding immediately followed by the remainder of the text
        item.
   255 - reserved, see section 6.



3. Master File Representation

   SINK resource records may appear as lines in zone master files.  The
   meaning, coding, and subcoding appear as unsigned decimal integers.
   The data portion can be quite long.  It is represented in base 64
   [RFC 2045] and may be divided up into any number of white space
   separated substrings, down to single base 64 digits, which are
   concatenated to obtain the full data.  These substrings can span
   lines using the standard parenthesis notation.  (This type of base64
   master file data is also required to support the DNS KEY and SIG
   security RRs [RFC 2535].)

4. Performance Considerations

   Currently DNS is optimized for small data transfers, generally not
   exceeding 512 octets including overhead.  Larger transfers are less
   efficient but do work correctly and efforts are underway to make them
   more efficient.

   It is easy to create very large RRs or RR sets using SINK.  DNS
   administrators should think about this and may wish to discourage
   large RRs or RR sets.  Consideration should also be given to putting
   zones from which large RRs or RR sets will be commonly retrieved on
   separate hosts which can be tuned for the load this will represent.



5. Security Considerations

   Since the SINK resource record can be used to store arbitrary data in
   the DNS, this data could have security consequences, particularly if
   it is control, executable, macro, or interpretable information or
   very large and might cause buffer overflow.  Due care should be
   taken.

   [RFC 2535] covers data original authentication of the data in the
   domain name system including SINK RRs.



6. IANA Considerations

   Assignment of specific meaning to the values listed herein as
   "reserved" requires an IETF standards action.

   All other assignments of available meaning, coding, or subcoding
   octet values are by IETF consensus.

   The many provisions for private indicita specified by separately
   allocated OIDs, domain names, or URIs should cover most requirements
   for private or proprietary values.
