                  DNSSEC Trust Anchor History Service
                draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-trust-history-02

Abstract

   When DNS validators have trusted keys, but have been offline for a
   longer period, key rollover will fail and they are stuck with stale
   trust anchors.  History service allows validators to query for older
   DNSKEY RRsets and pick up the rollover trail where they left off.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a trust history service for DNS validators -- the
   component in a resolver that performs DNSSEC [RFC4034] validation,
   validator for short.

   A validator that has been offline or missed an (emergency) rollover
   can use this service to reconfigure themselves with the current
   trust-anchor.  Using a newly defined resource record (RR) that links
   old DNSKEYS together, the TALINK RR, a validator fetches old DNSKEY
   RRsets and checks they form a chain to the latest key (see
   Section 3).  The lists of old DNSKEYS, linked with the TALINK RRs, do
   not necessarily need to be published in the zone for which the DNSKEY
   history is being maintained but can be published in any DNS domain.
   We will call the entity that offers the trust history the History
   Provider.  The choice of the History Provider is made by the
   maintainer of the validator, possibly based on a hint provided, using
   the TALINK, by the zone owner.

   Section 2 provides background on the mechanism and usage.  It looks
   at the viewpoints of publishers and consumers of trust anchors, the
   use of keys with revocation flags, and SEP flags.

   The algorithm that the validator uses to construct a history and
   reconfigure a new key is detailed in Section 4, it uses the TALINK RR
   type defined in Section 3.  The algorithms for how providers of trust
   history can fetch the DNSKEY data as published by the zone they track
   and publish that are explained in Section 5.

2.  Motivation and Description

   Validators provide a service in DNSSEC that can be seen from two
   ways.  Seen from the publisher's point of view, they provide
   assurance that the data as received is as it was when it left the
   publisher's hands.  In this way of looking at things, validators
   provide a publication integrity service.  The publisher can be
   confident that nobody can alter the published data (if it is
   validated), because any alteration will be detected.  So it protects
   a publisher from being seen to send someone to the wrong place.

   From the consumer's point of view, validators provide a reason to
   trust the data from the network.  In this view, the validator is

Internet-Draft            Trust History Service                June 2010


   making a claim about whether the data ought to be accepted or not.
   This is subtly different from the publisher's point of view, because
   the question for the consumer is not whether the data is safe while
   the consumer is not looking, but whether the data is safe for the
   consumer at the moment of consumption.  Validation protects a
   consumer from going to the wrong place.

   These two slightly different ways of looking at the situation result
   in slightly different operational goals.  Whereas publishers want to
   make assertions about their data, by controlling the roll over of
   keys, consumers want to get the best assurance that they can get that
   the data they are consuming is correct.

   If a validator has been offline during a key rollover event for one
   of its trust anchors, then the validator will be unable to validate
   answers that need that trust anchor.  For the publisher, this state
   of affairs is acceptable: the publisher is confident that no
   validator ever consumes the wrong data.  For the consumer, however,
   this state of affairs represents an outage.

   Since publishers of trust anchors already use a chained series of
   keys to perform rollovers under some circumstances (see [RFC5011]),
   it is possible to use the history of that chain to allow a validator
   to resume service for the consumer without needing to use an out-of-
   band mechanism to obtain a new trust anchor.  This improves the
   experience for consumers of validated data, and increases the chances
   that DNSSEC is useful for consumers of DNS data.

   The mechanism to do this is a double-linked list that recounts a
   portion of the history of DNSKEY Resource Records.  The list is used
   by a validator to catch up with the changes that the validator
   somehow missed.  This approach may be thought of as replaying the
   [RFC5011] rollover history, only at a later time.

2.1.  Considerations for Using a Revoked Key

   The keys that the publisher rolled are marked REVOKED by the RFC5011
   protocol.  At this point the publisher considers the keys revoked,
   but the validators have not yet seen this or marked the keys as
   revoked.  In the RFC5011 protocol, the validators probe regularly and
   can then see if keys are revoked.  If unable to probe, they will be
   unable to see if keys are revoked.  Hence when using a history to
   recount rollovers, the consumer's validator has also missed a number
   of revocations.  The goal is to pick up the right keys and also the
   new revocations along the way.

   Although the keys have been marked by the publisher as REVOKED a long
   time ago, for the consumer these REVOKED keys are new information.

Internet-Draft            Trust History Service                June 2010


   Their storage in the history list makes it possible for consumers to
   pick up key revocations if they missed the revocation announcement
   because they could not probe.

   This is the allowed usage of REVOKED keys.  The publisher is
   announcing their presence.  And the validators mark them as REVOKED
   after verification.  The initial part of this verification is the
   reverse walk through the history list, which is to avoid exposing
   which key is trusted.  This means that older signatures with keys
   that have in the meantime been revoked are used to construct and
   verify the history list by the validator.

   A consequence is that once a publisher marks keys as REVOKED, there
   will still be consumers who are using such keys, because they have
   not seen the revocation.  From the publishers point of view they are
   revoked and the revocation is filed in the historical key list.  From
   the consumers point of view, it has not seen a revocation yet, and a
   historical key list lookup algorithm is a state change where a new
   trusted key is obtained while the old key is observed to be revoked.

2.2.  Motivation for Requiring the SEP Bit

   The SEP bit is used to differentiate Key Signing Keys from other
   keys.  It is defined in [RFC3757], it is used to designate trust
   anchors in [RFC5011].  The protocol herein specified requires that
   DNSKEYs that are subject to use for the trust history service have
   the SEP bit set.  The reason for this is to keep the set of keys that
   need to be stored in history small.

3.  The  TALINK Resource Record

   The DNS Resource Record type TALINK (decimal 58) ties the elements of
   a linked list of DNSKEY RRs together.

   The rdata consists of two domain names.  The first name is the start,
   or previous name, and the other name the end or next name in the
   list.  The empty label '.' is used at the endpoints of the list.

   The presentation format is the two domain names.  The wire encoding
   is the two domain names, with no compression so the type can be
   treated according to [RFC3597].  The list is a double linked list,
   because this empowers low memory hosts to perform consistency checks.

   The TALINK used at the zone apex holds the endpoints of the list.
   The TALINKs that form the lists hold previous and next entries.
   These TALINKs are distinguished by their usage (entrypoint or list
   connection).  The double linked list is not circular, because lookups
   must stop when they reach the oldest entry.

4.  Trust History Lookup

   This is the algorithm that a validator uses to detect and resolve the
   situation in which a trust-anchor is out of sync with the DNSKEYs
   published by a zone owner.  The algorithm uses the TALINK RR type
   which is used to link various old DNSKEYs as published by the History
   Provider, to arrive from the outdated configured Trust Anchor to one
   that matches the current DNSKEY.  The TALINK RR type is defined in
   Section 3.

   When the algorithm below results in failure the trust history cannot
   be built and a new trust anchor will need to be re-configured using
   another mechanism.

   Step 1:  The validator performs a DNSKEY lookup to the target zone,
      which looks like any other initial DNSKEY lookup that the
      validator needs to match a trust anchor to the currently used
      DNSKEY RR set.  If the keyset verifies with the trust anchor
      currently held, the trust-anchor is not out of sync.  Otherwise,
      store the DNSKEY RR set as result.  The algorithm will
      successfully build a linked list to this DNSKEY RR, or delete the
      trust point, or fail.

      All nameservers (the ones authoritative for the zone or the
      upstream resolver caches when the validator is not full resolver)
      SHOULD be checked to make sure the DNSKEY RR sets are the same.
      The results can differ if a key-rollover is in progress and not
      all nameservers are in sync yet.  This case can be detected by
      checking that the older keyset signs the newer and take the newer
      as result keyset.  If both of the keysets sign each other, the
      result keyset has the newest rrsig that validates it using the
      other keyset.  Use the the average over the middle of the
      inception and expiration dates of the signatures that are
      validated (and for serial arithmetic assume all dates on these
      signatures lie within 2^(SERIAL_BITS-1) distance).  If the keysets
      do not sign each other then this is not a secure change in the
      keyset and the history lookup fails.

   Step 2:  Fetch the trust history list end points.  Perform a query of
      QTYPE TALINK and QNAME the domain name that is configured to be
      the History Provider for the particular domain you are trying to
      update the trust-anchor for.

   Step 3:  Go backwards through the trust history list as provided by
      the TALINK linked list.  Verify that the keyset validly signs the
      next keyset.  This is [RFC4034] validation, but the RRSIG
      expiration date is ignored.  Replace the owner domain name with
      the target zone name for verification.  One of the keys that signs

Internet-Draft            Trust History Service                June 2010


      the next keyset MUST have the SEP bit set.  The middle of
      inception and expiration date from the valid signature MUST be
      older than that of the signature that validates the next keys in
      the list.  Take the average if multiple signatures validate (and
      for serial arithmetic assume all dates on these signatures lie
      within 2^(SERIAL_BITS-1) distance).  Query type TALINK to get
      previous and next locations.

      If all SEP keys have the REVOKE flag set at this step, and the
      keyset is signed by all SEP keys, then continue but store that the
      end result is that the trust point is deleted, see Section 5
      [RFC5011].

      If all SEP keys are of an unknown algorithm at this step, continue
      and at the next step, when you verify if the keyset signs validly:
      if false, continue with result a failure, if true, continue with
      the end result that the trust point is deleted.  Thus, the keysets
      with unknown algorithms are stepped over with an end result of
      failure because the validator cannot determine if unknown
      algorithm signatures are valid, until the oldest keyset with
      unknown algorithms is signed by a known algorithm and the result
      is set to deletion and step 3 continues to a known key.

   Step 4:  When the trust anchor currently held by the validator
      verifies the keyset, the algorithm is done.  The validator SHOULD
      store the result on stable storage.  Use the new trust anchor for
      validation (if using [RFC5011], put it in state VALID).

5.  Trust History Tracker

   External trackers can poll the target zone DNSKEY RRset regularly.
   Ignore date changes in the RRSIG.  Ignore changes to keys with no SEP
   flag.  Copy the newly polled DNSKEY RRset and RRSIGs, change the
   owner name to a new name at the history location.  Publish the new
   RRset and TALINK records to make it the last element in the list.
   Update the TALINK that advertises the first and last name.

   Integrated into the rollover, the keys are stored in the history and
   the TALINK is updated when a new key is used in the rollover process.
   This gives the TALINK and new historical key time to propagate.

   The signer can support trust history.  Trust history key sets need
   only contain SEP keys.  To use older signers, move historical RRSIGs
   to another file.  Sign the zone, including the TALINK and DNSKEY
   records.  Append the historical RRSIGs to the result.  Signing the
   zone like this obviates the need for changes to signer and server
   software.

6.  Example

   In this example the trust history for the 'example.net' zone is
   published in the 'example.com' namespace.  The DNSKEY rdata and RRSIG
   rdata is omitted for brevity, it is a copy and paste of the data from
   example.net.

   $ORIGIN example.com.
   example.com. TALINK h0.example.com. h2.example.com.

   h0 TALINK . h1.example.com.
   h0 DNSKEY ...
   h0 RRSIG ...

   h1 TALINK h0.example.com. h2.example.com.
   h1 DNSKEY ...
   h1 RRSIG ...

   h2 TALINK h1.example.com. .
   h2 DNSKEY ...
   h2 RRSIG ...

   The example.net zone can advertise the example.com History Provider
   by providing the TALINK shown here at example.com at the apex of the
   example.net zone.  The TALINK at example.com is then not needed.

7.  Deployment

   The trust history is advertised with TALINK RRs at the zone apex.
   These represent alternative history sources, that can be searched in
   turn.  The TALINK at the zone apex contains the first and last name
   of the list of historical keys.

   The historical list of keys grows perpetually.  Since most validators
   have recent keys, their processing time remains similar as the list
   grows.  If validators no longer have trust in the keys then they need
   no longer be published.  The oldest key entries can be omitted from
   the list to shorten it.

   The validator decides how long it trusts a key.  A recommendation
   from the zone owner can be configured for keys of that zone, or
   recommendations per algorithm and key size can be used (e.g. see
   [NIST800-57]).  If a key is older than that, trust history lookup
   fails with it and the trust point can be considered deleted.  This
   assumes the validator has decided on a security policy and also can
   take actions when the update of the trust anchor fails.  Without such
   policy, or if the alternative is no DNSSEC, the approach below can be
   used.

Internet-Draft            Trust History Service                June 2010


   In general, the decision can be that any key - no matter how old or
   how small - is better than no security.  The validator then never
   considers a key too old, and the lookup algorithm becomes an
   unsecured update mechanism at the time where the key can be trivially
   broken.  The history provider SHOULD provide these broken keys to
   facilitate clients performing the unsecured update.  If a key can not
   be trivially broken then it provides a non-trivial amount of security
   that the history lookup algorithm uses to get the current keys.
   Conceivably after the update the result is stored on stable storage
   and the client is thereafter safe - it performs a leap of faith.  The
   validator operator can opt for this set up after considering the
   trade-off between loss of DNSSEC, loss of connectivity, and the
   argument that perceived security is worse than no security.

   The history lookup can be used on its own.  Then, the trust history
   is used whenever the key rolls over and no polling is performed.  The
   results of trust history lookup SHOULD be stored on stable storage,
   so that the trust history lookup does not need to be performed if the
   last results are okay and for use as trusted anchor in the next
   history lookup.

   If a validator is also using [RFC5011] for the target zone, then the
   trust history algorithm SHOULD only be invoked if the [RFC5011]
   algorithm failed due to the inability to perform probes.  This is the
   case when the last [RFC5011] successful probe was more than 30 days
   ago.  If a new key has been announced, invoke the history if no 2
   probes succeeded during the add hold-down time and there was no
   successful probe after the add hold-down time passed.  Therefore the
   time of the last successful probe MUST be stored on stable storage.

   For testing the potentially very infrequently used lookup, the
   following SHOULD be implemented.  For the test the lookup is
   triggered manually by allowing the system to be given a particular
   keyset with a last successful lookup date in the past and a test
   History Provider.  The test History Provider provides access to a
   generated back-dated test history.

8.  Security Considerations

   The History Provider only provides copies of old data.  If that
   historic data is altered or withheld the lookup algorithm fails
   because of validation errors in Step 3 of the algorithm.  If the
   History provider or a Man in the Middle Adversary (MIMA) has access
   to the original private keys (through theft, cryptanalisis, or
   otherwise), history can be altered without failure of the algorithm.
   Below we only consider MIMAs and assume the History Provider is a
   trusted party.

   Spoofing by a MIMA of data looked up in step 2 or 3, i.e. spoofing of
   TALINK and DNSKEY data, can present some alternate history.  However
   the DNSKEY RR set trusted that the history should arrive at is
   already fixed by step 1.  If an attempt is made to subvert the
   algorithm at step 2 or 3, then the result keyset can not be replaced
   by another keyset unnoticed.

   To change the keyset trusted as the outcome, the step 1 data has to
   be spoofed and the key held by the validator (or a newer historic
   key) has to be compromised.  Unless such spoof is targeted to a
   specific victim, a spoof of the step 1 result has a high visibility.
   Since most of the validators that receive the spoof have an up-to-
   date trust anchor most validators that would receive this spoof
   return validation failure for data from the zone that contains the
   DNSKEYs.  An adversary will therefore have to target the attack to
   validators that are in the process of an update.  Since validators do
   not announce that they use trust history lookup until step 2
   adversaries will not be able to select the validators.

   A spoof of data in steps 2 and 3, together with a compromised (old)
   key, can result in a downgrade.  At steps 2 and 3 a faked trust point
   deletion or algorithm rollover can be inserted in a fake history.
   This avoids the high visibility of spoofing the current key (see
   previous paragraph) and downgrades to insecure.

   Finally there is the case that one of the keys published by the
   History Providers has been compromised.  Since someone spoofing at
   step 1 of the lookup algorithm and presenting some fake history to a
   compromised key, of course does not include key revocations and does
   extend the history to contain the compromised key, it therefore is
   not really useful for a History Provider to remove the key from the
   published history.  That only makes lookups fail for those validators
   who are not under attack.  Useful action could be to update
   validators using some other means.

   Rollover with [RFC5011] revokes keys after use.  If a History
   Provider is used, then such revoked keys SHOULD be used to perform
   history tracking and history lookup.  The trust anchor keys that the
   validator has in its own storage and final current keys that it
   stores MUST NOT be trusted if they are revoked.

   If the validator operator chooses to operate trust history without
   also using [RFC5011] the trust anchor does not get hold-down timer
   protection.  This has associated risks, in that the immediate
   rollover without timeout that it provides could be abused (if private
   keys are compromised).  Such abuse could result in the stored lookup
   results to become compromised.  The key changes can be logged, to
   inform operators and keep an audit trail.

   The SEP bit is checked to make sure that control over the KSK is
   necessary to change the keyset for the target zone.

   The algorithm can be used to get the inception and expiration times
   of signatures on the current keyset, a clock.  A MIMA can attempt to
   shorten history and put back that clock, but the algorithm attempts
   to make this difficult to target and highly visible to others.

   If the clock of the validator can be influenced, then setting it
   forward is unlikely to give advantage, but setting it backward
   enables a replay attack of old DNSSEC data and signatures.  This
   vulnerability exists also in plain DNSSEC.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Resource record type TALINK has been defined using RFC5395 expert
   review, it has RR type number 58 (decimal).
