Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
   cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over
   DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms
   that is incomplete in that it lacks the implementation status of each
   algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on
   algorithm implementation compliance status for DNSSEC
   implementations.  This status is to measure compliance to this RFC
   only.  This document replaces that registry table with a new IANA
   registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm
   Numbers that lists (or assigns) each algorithm's status based on the
   current reference.

Internet-Draft             IANA Registry Fixes                  May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702] uses
   digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication and
   integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes for
   digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm
   and one-way hash function).

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC RFC's have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementers must read through
   all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are
   considered wise to implement, which are not, and which algorithms may
   become widely used in the future.  This document replaces the
   original list with a new table that includes the current compliance
   status for certain algorithms.

   This compliance status indication is only to be considered for
   implementation, not deployment or operations.  Operators are free to
   deploy any digital signature algorithm available in implementations
   or algorithms chosen by local security policies.  This status is to
   measure compliance to this RFC only.

   This document replaces the current IANA registry for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers with a newly defined
   registry table.  This new table (Section 2.2 below) contains a column
   that will list the current compliance status of each digital
   signature algorithm in the registry at the time of writing and
   assigns status for some algorithms used with DNSSEC that did not have
   an identified status in their specification.  This document updates
   the following: [RFC2536], [RFC2539], [RFC3110], [RFC4034], [RFC4398],
   [RFC5155], [RFC5702], and [RFC5933].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Number Sub-registry

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number sub-registry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be replaced with the
   table below.  This table is based on the existing DNS Security
   Algorithm Number sub-registry and adds a column that contains the
   current implementation status of the given algorithm.

   There are additional differences to entries that are described in
   sub-section 2.1.  The overall new registry table is in sub-section
   2.2.  The values for the compliance status were obtained from
   [RFC4034] with updates for algorithms specified after the original
   DNSSEC specification.  If no status was listed in the original
   specification, this document assigns one.

2.1.  Updates and Additions

   This document updates three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved
   until 2020".

   Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.

   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 is set to RECOMMENDED TO IMPLEMENT.
   This is due to the fact that RSA/SHA-1 is a MUST IMPLEMENT.  The
   status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are also set to RECOMMENDED TO
   IMPLEMENT as it is believed that these algorithms will replace an
   older algorithm (e.g.  RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness in
   its hash algorithm (SHA-1).

2.2.  Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number Registry Table

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number registry is
   hereby specified as follows below.  The new column is titled
   "Compliance to RFC TBD" (where TBD will change when published) as the
   IANA Registry table is not normative.  The IANA registry table is
   only a reflection of the RFC, which is normative.

   thereof) therefore cannot be included when judging compliance to this

   document.

2.3.  Specifying New Algorithms and Updating Status of Existing Entries

   [RFC6014] establishes a parallel procedure for adding a registry
   entry for a new algorithm other than a standards track document.
   Algorithms entered into the registry using that procedure do not have
   a listed compliance status.  Specifications that follow this path do
   not need to obsolete or update this document.

   Adding a newly specified algorithm to the registry with a compliance
   status SHALL entail obsolescing this document and replacing the
   registry table (with the new algorithm entry).  Altering the status
   column value of any existing algorithm in the registry SHALL entail
   obsoleting this document and replacing the registry table.

   This document cannot be updated, only made obsolete and replaced by a
   successor document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry.  The new registry table is in Section
   2.2.  In the column "Compliance to RFC TBD", "RFC TBD" should be
   changed to the official RFC when published.

   The original Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number
   registry is available at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry.  It is not meant to be a discussion on
   algorithm superiority.  No new security considerations are raised in
   this document.
