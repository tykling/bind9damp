                   DNS Referral Response Size Issues
                      draft-ietf-dnsop-respsize-14

Abstract

   With a mandated default minimum maximum UDP message size of 512
   octets, the DNS protocol presents some special problems for zones
   wishing to expose a moderate or high number of authority servers (NS
   RRs).  This document explains the operational issues caused by, or
   related to this response size limit, and suggests ways to optimize
   the use of this limited space.  Guidance is offered to DNS server
   implementors and to DNS zone operators.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   The original DNS standard limited the UDP message size to 512 octets
   (see Section 4.2.1 of [RFC1035]).  Even though this limitation was
   due to the required minimum IP reassembly limit for IPv4, it became a
   hard DNS protocol limit and is not implicitly relaxed by changes in a
   network layer protocol, for example to IPv6.

   The EDNS (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) protocol extension starting
   with version 0 permits larger responses by mutual agreement of the
   requester and responder (see Section 4.3 and Section 6.2 of
   [RFC2671bis]), and it is recommended to support EDNS.  The 512 octets
   UDP message size limit will remain in practical effect until
   virtually all DNS servers and resolvers support EDNS.

   Since DNS responses include a copy of the request, the space
   available for response data is somewhat less than the full 512
   octets.  Negative responses are quite small, but for positive and
   referral responses, every octet must be carefully and sparingly
   allocated.  While the response size of positive responses is also a
   concern in [RFC3226], this document specifically addresses referral
   response size.

   While more than twelve years passed since the publication of the
   original EDNS0 document [RFC2671], approximately 65% of the clients
   support it as observed at a root name server and this fraction has
   not changed in recent few years.  The long tail of EDNS deployment
   may eventually be measured in decades.

   Even if EDNS deployment reached 100% of all DNS initiators and
   responders there will still be cases when path MTU limitations or IP

   fragmentation/reassembly problems in firewalls and other middleboxes
   will cause EDNS failures which leads to non-extended DNS retries.  A
   smaller referral response will always be better than a larger one if
   the same end result can be achieved either way.  See [RFC5625],
   [SSAC035], and Section 6.2.6 of [RFC2671bis] for details.


2.  Delegation Details

2.1.  Relevant Protocol Elements

   A positive delegation response will include the following elements:

       Header Section: fixed length (12 octets)
       Question Section: original query (name, class, type)
       Answer Section: empty, or a CNAME/DNAME chain
       Authority Section: NS RRset (nameserver names)
       Additional Section: A and AAAA RRsets (nameserver addresses)
   Note: CNAME defines a canonical name ([RFC1034]) while DNAME maps an
   entire subtree to another domain ([RFC2672]).

   If the total size of the UDP response exceeds 512 octets or the size
   advertised in EDNS, and if the data that does not fit was "required",
   then the TC bit will be set (indicating truncation).  This will
   usually cause the requester to retry using TCP, depending on what
   information was desired and what information was omitted.  For
   example, truncation in the authority section is of no interest to a
   stub resolver who only plans to consume the answer section.  If a
   retry using TCP is needed, the total cost of the transaction is much
   higher.  See Section 6.1.3.2 of [RFC1123] for details on the
   requirement that UDP be attempted before falling back to TCP.

   RRsets (Resource Record Set, see [RFC2136]) are never sent partially
   unless the TC bit is set to indicate truncation.  When the TC bit is
   set, the final apparent RRset in the final non-empty section must be
   considered "possibly damaged" (see Section 6.2 of [RFC1035] and
   Section 9 of [RFC2181]).

   With or without truncation, the glue present in the additional data
   section should be considered "possibly incomplete", and requesters
   should be prepared to re-query for any damaged or missing RRsets.
   Note that truncation of the additional data section might not be
   signaled via the TC bit since additional data is often optional (see
   discussion in Appendix B of [RFC4472]).

   DNS label compression allows the component labels of a domain name to
   be instantiated exactly once per DNS message, and then referenced
   with a two-octet "pointer" from other locations in that same DNS

   message (see Section 4.1.4 of [RFC1035]).  If all nameserver names in
   a message share a common parent (for example, all of them are in
   "ROOT-SERVERS.NET." zone), then more space will be available for
   incompressible data (such as nameserver addresses).

   The query name can be as long as 255 octets of network data.  In this
   worst case scenario, the question section will be 259 octets in size,
   which would leave only 240 octets for the authority and additional
   sections (after deducting 12 octets for the fixed length header) in a
   referral.

2.2.  Advice to Zone Owners

   Average and maximum question section sizes can be predicted by the
   zone owner, since they will know what names actually exist and can
   measure which ones are queried for most often.  Note that if the zone
   contains any wildcards, it is possible for maximum length queries to
   require positive responses, but that it is reasonable to expect
   truncation and TCP retry in that case.  For cost and performance
   reasons, the majority of requests should be satisfied without
   truncation or TCP retry.

   Some queries to non-existing names can be large, but this is not a
   problem because negative responses need not contain any answer,
   authority or additional records.  See Section 2.1 of [RFC2308] for
   more information about the format of negative responses.

   The minimum useful number of name servers is two, for redundancy (see
   Section 4.1 of [RFC1034]).  A zone's name servers should be reachable
   by all IP protocols versions (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) in common use.  As
   long as the servers are well managed, the server serving IPv6 might
   be different from the server serving IPv4 sharing the same server
   name.

   The best case is no truncation at all.  This is because many
   requesters will retry using TCP immediately, or will automatically
   requery for RRsets that are possibly truncated, without considering
   whether the omitted data was actually necessary.

   Anycasting [RFC3258] is a useful tool for performance and reliability
   without increasing the size of referral responses.

   While it is irrelevant to the response size issue, all zones have to
   be served via IPv4 as well to avoid name space fragmentation
   [RFC3901].

2.3.  Advice to Server Implementors

   Each NS RR for a zone will add 12 fixed octets (name, type, class,
   ttl, and rdlen) plus 2 to 255 variable octets (for the NSDNAME).
   Each A RR will require 16 octets, and each AAAA RR will require 28
   octets.

   While DNS distinguishes between necessary and optional resource
   records, this distinction is according to protocol elements necessary
   to signify facts, and takes no official notice of protocol content
   necessary to ensure correct operation.  For example, a nameserver
   name that is in or below the zone cut being described by a delegation
   is "necessary content", since there is no way to reach that zone
   unless the parent zone's delegation includes "glue records"
   describing that name server's addresses.

   Recall that the TC bit is only set when a required RRset can not be
   included in its entirety (see Section 9 of [RFC2181]).  Even when
   some of the RRsets to be included in the additional section don't fit
   in the response size, the TC bit isn't set.  These RRsets may be
   important for a referral.  Some DNS implementations try to resolve
   these missing glue records separately which will introduce extra
   queries and extra time to resolve a given name.

   A delegation response should prioritize glue records as follows.

   first:
       All glue RRsets for one name server whose name is in or below the
       zone being delegated, or which has multiple address RRsets
       (currently A and AAAA), or preferably both;
   second:
       Alternate between adding all glue RRsets for any name servers
       whose names are in or below the zone being delegated, and all
       glue RRsets for any name servers who have multiple address RRsets
       (currently A and AAAA);
   thence:
       All other glue RRsets, in any order.

   Whenever there are multiple candidates for a position in this
   priority scheme, one should be chosen on a round-robin or fully
   random basis.  The goal of this priority scheme is to offer
   "necessary" glue first to fill into the response if possible.

   If any "necessary" content cannot be fit in the response, then it is
   advisable that the TC bit be set in order to force a TCP retry,
   rather than have the zone be unreachable.  Note that a parent
   server's proper response to a query for in-child glue or below-child
   glue is a referral rather than an answer, and that this referral must

Internet-Draft         DNS Referral Response Size               May 2012


   be able to contain the in-child or below-child glue, and that in
   outlying cases, only EDNS or TCP will be large enough to contain that
   data.

   The glue record order should be independent of the version of IP used
   in the query because the DNS server might just see a query from an
   intermediate server rather than the query from the original client.


3.  Analysis

   An instrumented protocol trace of a best case delegation response is
   shown in Figure 1.  Note that 13 servers are named, and 13 addresses
   are given.  This query was artificially designed to exactly reach the
   512 octets limit.

   For longer query names, the number of address records supplied will
   be lower.  Furthermore, it is only by using a common parent name
   (which is "GTLD-SERVERS.NET." in this example) that all 13 addresses
   are able to fit, due to the use of DNS compression pointers in the
   last 12 occurrences of the parent domain name.  The outputs from the
   response simulator in Appendix A (written in perl [PERL]) shown in
   Figure 2 and Figure 3 demonstrate these properties.

   these examples we use an average/common name size of 15 octets,

   We're assuming a medium query name size of 64 since that is the
   typical size seen in trace data at the time of this writing.  If

   EDNS, then new measurements and new estimates will have to be made.


4.  Conclusions

   The current practice of giving all nameserver names a common parent
   (such as "GTLD-SERVERS.NET." or "ROOT-SERVERS.NET.") saves space in
   DNS responses and allows for more nameservers to be enumerated than
   would otherwise be possible, since the common parent domain name only
   appears once in a DNS message and is referred to via "compression
   pointers" thereafter.

   If all nameserver names for a zone share a common parent, then it is
   operationally advisable to make all servers for the zone thus served
   also be authoritative for the zone of that common parent.  For
   example, the root name servers (?.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.) can answer
   authoritatively for the ROOT-SERVERS.NET. zone.  This is to ensure
   that the zone's servers always have the zone's nameservers' glue
   available when delegating, and will be able to respond with answers
   rather than referrals if a requester who wants that glue comes back
   asking for it.  In this case the name server will likely be a
   "stealth server" -- authoritative but unadvertised in the glue zone's
   NS RRset.  See Section 2 of [RFC1996] for more information about
   stealth servers.

   Thirteen (13) is the effective maximum number of nameserver names
   usable with traditional (non-extended) DNS, assuming a common parent
   domain name, and given that implicit referral response truncation is
   undesirable in the average case.

   More than one address record in a protocol family per server is
   inadvisable since the necessary glue RRsets (A or AAAA) are
   atomically indivisible, and will be larger than a single resource
   record.  Larger RRsets are more likely to lead to or encounter
   truncation.

   More than one address record across protocol families is less likely
   to lead to or encounter truncation, partly because multiprotocol
   clients, which are required to handle larger RRsets such as AAAA RRs,
   are more likely to speak EDNS, which can use a larger UDP response
   size limit, and partly because the resource records (A and AAAA) are
   in different RRsets and are therefore divisible from each other.

   Name server names that are at or below the zone they serve are more
   sensitive to referral response truncation, and glue records for them
   should be considered "more important" than other glue records, in the
   assembly of referral responses.
