			[RT #33111]

3523.	[contrib]	Ported filesystem and ldap DLZ drivers to
			dynamically-loadable modules, and added the
			"wildcard" module based on a contribution from
			Vadim Goncharov <vgoncharov@nic.ru>. [RT #23569]

			so that all dns_rrl_rtype_t enum values fit regardless
			of whether it is teated as signed or unsigned by
			the compiler. [RT #32792]

3507.	[bug]		Statistics channel XSL had a glitch when attempting
			to chart query data before any queries had been
			received. [RT #32620]

3494.	[func]		DNS RRL: Blunt the impact of DNS reflection and
			amplification attacks by rate-limiting substantially-
			identical responses. To enable, use "configure
			--enable-rrl". [RT #28130]

3490.	[bug]		When logging RDATA during update, truncate if it's
			too long. [RT #32365]

			backward compatibility between versions of DLZ dlopen
			API. [RT #32275]

3434.	[bug]		Pass client info to the DLZ findzone() entry
			point in addition to lookup().  This makes it
			possible for a database to answer differently
